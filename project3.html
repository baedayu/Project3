     <p> I. Web pages are composed with HTML. Understanding the basic syntax of 
      HTML is needed to make a web page. </p> 
     <p> II. Using <b>tags</b>, we can <em>insert images/links</em> and <em>
      change plain text into bold or italic</em>. </p>
     <p> III. The set of opening tag, content and closing tag is called an 
      <b><em>"element"</em></b>. There are <b>inline</b> and <b>block</b> 
      elements. The block elements makes <em>invisible boxes</em> <small>while 
      inline don't</small>. </p> 
     <p> IV. We can add style by using CSS. And the whole HTML document has a 
      structure, <small>which we would be learning in future lectures.</small>

       <li> <b>DOCTYPE html</b> on the first line declared that the document is 
        a HTML document </li>
       <li> Some tags are used to describe the structure: <em> html, head, 
        title, body, h1 (heading), p (paragraph) </em> </li> 
       <li> We <b>indent</b> while writing codes to make the structure of HTML

     <h3 class="description-title"> IV. Computer program needs to be 
      structured. </h3>
      <p>
       That means there are some rules when writing codes. The computer 
       reads the lines from the top to the bottom. So the logical flow of the 
       code have to be aligned in the same direction. The code's have to be 
       divided into meaningful components. And we need to minimize repeating 
       same lines. If we know the structure, we can predict the organization 
       of code's content. Well structured programs are easily read and understood.
      </p>
      <p> There are several benefits of avoiding repetition. First, we can 
       minimize the total length of the code. Therefore, there are less to 
       write, less risks of making errors and less to read. Second, it makes 
       future changes easier and simple by putting same components together. 
       If we have written the same codes several times, we should have find 
       where the same parts are and change all of them one after one.

     <p>
      I. We can do any computation by designing a program using programming 
      language (like Python!) to make the computer do processing step by step 
      and eventually accomplish the final goal. 
     </p> 
     <p>
      II. The python interpreter reads and execute the program.
     </p> 
     <p>
      III. BE CAREFUL!! The program must exactly adhere to the strict 
      grammatical rule. Unless "Syntax error" will appear. And the meaning of 
      the programming language must be clear (interpreted in only one way), 
      not ambiguous. 
     </p>

  <div class = "session">
   <h2 class = "session-title"> [2] Variables and strings </h2> 
    <div class="description">
     <p> I. We can assign a number or string into a <b> variable </b> 
      by using "=". </p>
      <div class="code"> variable name = number or string </div> <br> 
      <div class="code"> "=" </div> : Puts the content on the right into 
      the left. 
     <p> II. Variables can be repeatly used and updated to a new value. 
      Useful in loops and functions. </p>
     <p> III. Strings are chain of characters or numbers. We can index, 
      parcellate strings and find subcomponent strings. Useful in text mining. 
     </p> 
      <div class="code"> "string"[a:b] </div> <br> 
      <div class="code"> &lt;string&gt;.find(&lt;component&gt;)

      the location where the first found component starts <br> 
      <div class="code"> &lt;string&gt;.find(&lt;component&gt;, number)

  <div class = "session">
   <h2 class = "session-title"> [3] Input-function-output </h2> 
    <div class="description">
     <p> I. Function(procedure) allows us to store the repeating contents 
      and call the function when needed, not writing the same codes over and over. </p>
     <p> II. We can make functions. When needed, we call the function and 
      give appropriate number of inputs then the output would be returned! </p>
      <div class = "code"> "function name" (input1, input2, ...): <br>

  <div class = "session">
   <h2 class = "session-title"> [4] Decision and Repetition: If and While loop </h2> 
    <div class="description">
     <p> 
      I. Conditional execution of codes are able by using <b>if statements</b>. 
      The code within the the block would be executed only when the if statement 
      is <b>true</b>. </p>
      <div class="code"> if "statement": <br> 
       <div class="indent">
       code to do when the if statement is true 
       </div> <br>
       else: 
      </div> <br>
      => We can add what to do when the if statement is not true.
     <p>
      II. If statement executes one or zero times. While loop would be repeated 
      <b>while</b> it is true. We can use while loop to do something repeated 
      for a limited time. </p>
      <div class = "code"> i = 0 <br>
       while i &lt; 10: <br>
       <div class="indent"> 
        print i <br>
        i = i + 1
       </div>
      </div> <br> 
      => This while loop would print numbers until the i is smaller than 10: 
      0 to 9. 
     <p> 
      III. Infinite loop and break statement! If the while loop is always true, 
      the loop would keep going which makes it an <b>Infinite loop!!</b> 
      We have to check carefully, whether the loop ends. Break statement is 
      useful to ensure the termination. </p> 
      <div class="code"> While statement: <br>
       <div class="indent"> if statement: <br> 
       break 
       </div> <br> 
      </div>
      <br>
      => When the if statement comes true, the interpreter would come out 
      from the while loop and go to the next line of code. 
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class = "session">
   <h2 class = "session-title"> [5] Structured data: lists and for loop </h2> 
    <div class="description">
     <p> 
      I. String is a type of structural data where the elements are characters. 
      Lists include all types of elements like characters, strings, numbers and nested lists. </p>
      <div class="code"> list = ['number', 'string', 'list', characters'] </div> <br>
      <div class="code"> list[0] </div> :select first element of the list <br>
      <div class="code"> list[1:3] </div> :select second to third element of the list
     <p> 
      II. The <b>BIG</b> difference of lists from strings: Mutation and aliasing. </p>
      <ol>
       <li> Mutation: We can change the element of lists. </li>
       <li> Aliasing: If we change the list, the variable that are assigned to 
        that object also changes together. </li>
      </ol>
      <div class="code">
       list = [a, b, c, d] <br>
       newlist = list  <br>
       list[2] = [e] <br>
       print list <br>
       <div class="indent">
        list = [a, b, e, d] </div> 
        <br>
       print newlist <br>
       <div class="indent">
       newlist = [a, b, e, d] </div> 
      </div> <br>
       => Python is not assigning a new list to the variable. The object 
       is actually changed. Thus new assignment nor return statement 
       (in functions) are not needed. 
     <p> III. Lists operations </p>
      <ol>
       <li> 'list'.append('element') : adds the element to the original list </li>
       <li> 'list1'+'list2' : produces a new list with the elements of list1 and list2 </li>
       <li> len('list') : number of the elements within the list <br>
        <div class="code"> len(['a','b', ['c','d']]) = 3 </div>
       </li>
       <li> 'list'.index('element') : the index of the first appearance of 
        element in the list <br>
        <div class="code"> p.index(t)</div>
       </li>
      </ol>
     <p> IV. For loops and Lists: Using for loops, we can repeat the codes over 
      the elements in a list. </p>
      <div class = "code"> for e in p: <br>
       <div class="indent"> insert codes like if statements 
       </div>
      </div>
      <ol> 
       <li> Find elements within the list <br> Useful if statement:
        <div class="code"> "If A in B:" or "If A not in B" 
        </div>
       </li>
       <li> Repeat same procedure over the elements, one-by-one </li>
      </ol>
    </div>
  </div>
  <br>

  <div class = "summary">
   <h2 class = "summary-title"> Summary </h2>

   <h2 class="session-title"> [1] What is Object Oriented Programming? </h2> 
    <div class = "description">
     <h3 class="description-title"> 1. Definition
     </h3>
     <p>
      I. Class is a data structure that has attributes and methods. Methods 
      are procedures, functions defined within the class. <b> Class </b> 
      is a kind of backbone, blueprint. We can make different <em>objects</em> 
      belonging to a same class. The detailed data within attributes are 
      different, but we can use same methods with objects. 
     </p>
      <!-- Referred by Wickipedia, URL: "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object
     -oriented_programming" -->
     <p>
      II. Object oriented programming is one of the programming paradigms 
      which emphasize the usefulness of objects. It makes applying others 
      code easier. And by using functions and classes already available, 
      the programmers can focus more on the present work. 
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li> Turtle: draw lines, shapes </li>
      <li> Twilio: send SMS </li>
     </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="description">
     <h3 class="description-title"> 2. Difference from using functions </h3>
     <p>
      I. We can import modules from Python Standard Library or external 
      libraries to use functions. Module is a upper category consisted with 
      functions. Function receive and process the input and return the output. 
      There are situations when using class has more advantages. 
     </p>
     <p>
      Example) Making a movie site </p>
      <ul>
        <li> Function: We have to use series of function to reach the final 
         result. We have to give the entire data when calling the function. 
         Because different movies needs different data, we should have to make 
         separate python files for each movie. If we want to make a change 
         within a function, we should have to change all of the separate python 
         files. </li>
        <li> Class: We make a new class needed to make a movie site. 
         The data structure and functions are designed. Then we can make 
         different objects of each movie to manipulate. If we want to make a 
         change, we only have to revise the class or instance variable. </li>
      </ul>
     <p>
      II. In large programming projects, object oriented programming is a 
      valuable tool. We can use already available objects or make one. 
      Then make instances and use the instance variable and method. 
      It enables us to think and construct the blueprint first, 
      then fill in with actual data. One by one. Separating the content and 
      structure is similar with html and css. In the CSS file, we define the 
      text color, font, line width ... of each class. If we change the variable 
      within a class, the text that is classified to that class appears 
      different automatically in the webpage.  
     </p>

  </div>

  <div class="session">
   <h2 class="session-title"> [2] More Concepts Based on the Movie Class Example
   </h2>
    <div class = "description">
      Code example
      <div class = "code">
        class Movie(): <br>
           <div class="indent">
            def __init__(self, movie_title, movie_storyline, image, trailer): <br>
             <div class="indent">
              self.title = movie_title <br>
              self.storyline = movie_storyline <br>
              self.image = image <br>
              self.trailer = trailer 
             </div>
           </div>
           <div class="indent">
            def show_trailer(self): <br>
            <div class="indent">
              webbrowser.open(self.trailer) 
            </div>
           </div>
      </div> 
     <h3 class="description-title"> 1. Constructor </h3>
      <p>
        I. When we initialize a class, __init__ function is called first. 
        This function makes space wihin the memory for the new instance. 
        Thus the __init__ function in named the "constructor". 
      </p>
      <p>
        II. The first variable of the constructor is the instance itself, "self". 
        Then the attributes follow. The Movie class example have four data 
        attributes which are the instance variables. Class variables are the 
        common attributes that applies to all of the instances made by the class. 
      </p> 
     <h3 class="description-title"> 2. Method </h3>
      <p>
        I. There are functions that we can use with the class. In this example, 
        we can open the movie trailer URL using the show_trailer method. 
        (We have to import webbrowser module to use this method)
      </p>
      <p> 
        II. Other examples: Turtle - forward, right, circle 
      </p>
      <h3 class="description-title"> 3. Inheritance, method overriding </h3>
       <p>
        I. We can reuse a part of the Class code by making a Class Child. 
        We insert the code below inside the __init__function. 
       </p>
       <div class="code"> 
        class Child(Parent):
        <div class="indent">
          def __init__ (self, var1, var2, var3):
          <div class="indent">
            Parent.__init__(self, var1, var2)
          </div>
        </div>
       </div>
       <p>
        II. When we call the class Child, the var1, var2 is inherited. 
        It equals to the class Parent's instant variable. 
       </p>
       <p> 
        III. If we separately define the method within the Child class, t
        his overrides the Parent's definition. Otherwise it is inherited by 
        the Parent class. Inheritance and method overriding enables both 
        reusing the code and adding new content. 
       </p>
